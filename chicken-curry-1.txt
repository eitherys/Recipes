Nabeel's Chicken Curry

Ingredients:
2 Onions
2 lbs Chicken Breast (1" cubed)
2 Tomatoes (add another if you like tomato)
1 tbsp Garam Masala
1 tbsp Paprika
1 tsp Turmeric (optional, but recommended)
1/2 tsp Chili Powder (optional, but recommended)
1 tsp Cinnamon
2 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (or minced/powdered equivalent)
1 tbsp Salt
1 tsp Black Pepper
2 tbsp plain yogurt (optional, recommended if eating with bread since it gets creamy)
1 green chili pepper (optional)

Sautee the onions on medium-low heat in a large pot using whatever choice of wet fat (butter, olive oil is what I use, veggie oil is what my mom uses, other subtitutes). Add the garam masala, chili powder, paprika, and cinnamon directly to the cooking onions. Mix around, they should color the onions and release the aromas.

While that's going, cut the chicken up into cubes, then shovel them in after the onions have been cooking for 10-15 minutes (or before they burn). Mix it immediately, so that the spiced onions coat the chicken and make contact with the flavors. Cut up the tomatoes and add them in after.

Now you can basically dump in the rest of everything. The salt, pepper, ginger-garlic, yogurt, peppers, etc. Mix it all in evenly, and cover the pot, allowing it to cook on medium heat for a little while, say 20-30 minutes. You should see the tomatoes shrivel up, and the chicken should be soft and fall apart when you press a spoon through it. That's a good time to eat.

You can also add some chopped cilantro for garnish if you want. Serve with rice, or pita, naan, roti, etc.

For good rice, wash it thoroughly, put some oil and salt into the pot first, then add the rice, then add water (2 parts water for 1 part rice). Place lid on pot, put on high temp until rolling boil, then shift to lowest heat immediately. Let cook until water disappears, then turn off heat and take lid off, let sit for a few minutes to have any excess moisture escape.
